## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Outgoing compose workflow (local tickets 01–06).** Recipient display names
  are accepted with strict address validation and JSON-encoded JXA objects;
  quote names containing commas. `create_draft` and `reply_draft` are
  draft-only entry points, while `send_email` and `reply_email` retain
  draft-by-default, explicit-confirmation sending. Native replies use scoped
  source lookup and Mail's threading headers. Compose results include
  structured recipients and a scoped saved-draft reference when verified,
  with explicit unconfirmed readback otherwise. Disabled sender accounts are
  rejected before composing. CLI twins: `draft`, `reply`, `reply-draft`;
  `--body -` reads stdin. All tools expose MCP risk annotations.
- **Full-email recipients.** `get_email` now returns structured `to` and `cc`
  recipients on disk and every JXA fallback path, including decoded RFC 2047
  display names. Empty headers produce empty lists.

- **Global development launcher.** `just setup` now binds the global
  `apple-mail-mcp` command to the current checkout, with editable source and
  locked dependency sync on each launch. `just dev-link`, `just dev-status`,
  and `just dev-unlink` manage the link and preserve the previous executable
  for rollback. Source edits need no reinstall; running MCP sessions still
  need a restart. Status validates the pinned uv executable even when PATH
  selects a different shim. No editor-specific reinstall hook is required.

- **Domain glossary and identity ADR.** `CONTEXT.md` defines mail terminology,
  identity, access boundaries, outgoing-mail states, and search coverage.
  `docs/adr/0001-scoped-email-identity.md` records the existing scoped index
  identity and distinguishes numeric Mail IDs from Internet Message-ID headers.

- **Write tools (opt-out via read-only mode).** Three consolidated mutating tools, each a thin JXA call that returns the resulting state rather than `{"success": true}`: `update_email_status(message_ids, read?, flagged?)` marks read/unread and flags/unflags (#64, supersedes #24); `move_email(message_ids, target_mailbox)` moves to any mailbox — `Archive` and `Trash` are just targets — resolving the destination before touching a message so an unknown target is a clean `ValueError` (#65, supersedes #23); `send_email(to, subject, body, cc?, bcc?, account?, confirm=False)` composes through `Mail.OutgoingMessage` and **saves a draft unless `confirm=True`**, so an agent has to surface the content before anything leaves the machine (#22). All three call `_ensure_writable()` first (`APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY` / `serve -r` refuse with `PermissionError`), never fall through to a hidden account (#90), and clamp `message_ids` to `MAX_WRITE_BATCH = 10`. `move_email` evicts the stale index row for the source mailbox as soon as Mail.app confirms the move, so an immediate `search()` cannot return a ghost; the watcher re-indexes the message in its new mailbox (#66, optimistic update). CLI twins: `apple-mail-mcp mark`, `move`, `send`.

### Performance

- **CLI commands no longer pay for `import fastmcp` (~1s).** `server.mcp` is now a small registry that records `@mcp.tool` / `@mcp.resource` at import and builds the real `FastMCP` on the first `run()` — the only caller that needs it. `import apple_mail_mcp.server` drops from ~2.0s to ~0.25s, so `apple-mail-mcp read` / `search` / `emails` are bounded by the actual work again. A test builds the real server in the suite and checks its roster against the decorators, so a tool signature fastmcp can't schema-ify still fails in CI rather than at `serve` time.
- **`scripts/smoke.sh` reads an indexed message.** It used to read the newest message from `emails`, which is almost never in the index yet (no `serve` has synced), so the timing measured the JXA fallback walking the whole mailbox (~6–11s on a 5K-message INBOX) instead of the disk path it claims to exercise.
- **Highlighted search no longer scales with the number of matches.** `search(..., highlight=True)` (the CLI `search` default) ran FTS5 `highlight()`/`snippet()` over *every* matching row before the `ORDER BY score LIMIT` pruned to one page — for a common term on a ~130K-row index that was 1.5–4s per query (`just smoke` measured `search` at ~5s). The highlight path now ranks and filters in a rowid-only subquery and runs the auxiliary functions only on the returned page: ~0.3s for the worst case, 2–6x faster on typical terms, unchanged on rare ones, with identical rows, order, and scores. The unary `+` on the outer rowid (`+emails_fts.rowid IN (...)`) is load-bearing — without it SQLite re-runs the MATCH once per result row.
- **`get_email()` disk reads skip the JXA account-map load when nothing needs it.** With no `account` hint and no `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_EXCLUDE_ACCOUNTS`, Strategy 0 needed the name↔UUID map for nothing, yet paid an `osascript` round-trip (~250ms cold) on every cold process — i.e. every CLI `read`. The map still loads whenever an account name or configured exclusions must be translated, so the hidden-account gate is unchanged. The remaining ~1s of CLI wall time is the `fastmcp` import.

### Changed

- **fastmcp 4 (spike).** `fastmcp>=4.0.11,<5` (MCP Python SDK v2). No
  server code changes; tools/list, annotations and `index://status` are
  wire-identical except tools now carry auto-generated `title`s. The
  annotation test reads the SDK v2 snake_case fields.

- **Faster CI scheduling.** Run mocked tests on Linux for Python 3.11–3.13,
  retaining one macOS Python 3.13 compatibility job on pushes to main.
  Test jobs have a ten-minute execution timeout.

- **Developer workflow overhaul** — `justfile` task runner (`just check` is the local mirror of CI), targeted `just test-changed`, opt-in git hooks (`just hooks`: staged-file ruff on commit, changed-file tests on push), `scripts/release.sh` collapsing the 4-step release checklist, `scripts/smoke.sh` for real-Mail.app verification, Claude Code project settings + skills (`.claude/`) and an `AGENTS.md` mirror for Codex. Test suite wall time drops from ~280s to ~3s: nine `test_manager.py` tests were walking the developer's real `~/Library/Mail`; a conftest guard now keeps the whole suite off it. `tests/` is in the ruff lint scope. New `tests/test_release_metadata.py` fails the build when `pyproject.toml`/`server.json` versions diverge, when the `CHANGELOG.md` lacks a section for the current version, or when the tool roster in `server.py` drifts from the counts and tables in README/CLAUDE.md/docs.
- **Type checking is a gate.** `ty` (pinned in the dev group) runs in `just check` and CI after ruff; the 27 pre-existing diagnostics are fixed. `fastmcp` is bumped from `3.0.0b1` to `>=3.4.7` — the beta typed `@mcp.tool` as returning a `FunctionTool`, which made every direct call of a tool (the CLI, the deprecated `get_attachment` alias) a type error; 3.4 returns the decorated function. The CLI `--scope`/`--filter` options are now `Literal` types, so an invalid value is rejected at parse time with the list of choices instead of reaching the server.

### Fixed

- **Release packaging stays in sync.** `just release` now validates and
  updates the plugin, marketplace plugin entry, and Claude Desktop bundle
  versions alongside Python/MCP metadata and the lockfile. It commits all
  version files and leaves the marketplace's independent metadata version
  unchanged. Version mismatches fail before any file is rewritten; regression
  tests exercise the release commit and bundle filename in temporary repos.

- **`date_received` from the `.emlx` plist footer was never used.** The fallback for a message whose headers carry no `Date` referenced `datetime.UTC` on the *class* (the constant lives on the module), raised `AttributeError` inside a best-effort `except Exception`, and silently left `date_received` empty. Surfaced by the type checker. (`index/disk.py`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin and Claude Desktop bundle.** Two new install surfaces, both thin launchers around the released PyPI package rather than vendored copies: the repo doubles as a Claude Code plugin marketplace (`claude plugin marketplace add imdinu/apple-mail-mcp` then `claude plugin install apple-mail@imdinu`), and every GitHub Release now carries an `apple-mail-mcp-<version>.mcpb` that Claude Desktop installs with a double-click. The shared launcher (`plugin/start.sh`) resolves uvx → pipx → a private venv, and prepends the Homebrew and `~/.local/bin` paths that GUI-launched MCP hosts omit from their environment — the usual cause of "works in Terminal, fails in Desktop". Both surfaces share the same index as a manual install. (#114)

### Fixed

- **A denied disk read is reported as a permission problem, not a missing item.** Without Full Disk Access on the process running the server, `get_emails()` failed outright instead of cascading to its JXA fallback, `get_email_attachment()` reported an attachment that `get_email()` had just listed as "not found", and `get_email_links()` reported an email had no links. Root cause across all three: `PermissionError` is a sibling of `FileNotFoundError` under `OSError`, and the handlers written for "file missing" let a TCC denial walk past — on macOS, `stat()` on a protected file succeeds and only the read fails, which made this look like a data bug. `get_emails()` cascades again, and the attachment and link paths raise an actionable message naming Full Disk Access for the process that launches the server. `Path.exists()` pre-checks, which return `False` on `EACCES`, are replaced with `stat()` throughout `disk.py`. Diagnosis by matwhiting; `get_emails` fix by kznmd. (#109, #113, #126)
- **`search()` on an excluded account no longer has a distinguishable response shape.** An account hidden via `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_EXCLUDE_ACCOUNTS` returned a bare `[]` where any other name — existing or not — got the `{"result": [], "hint": ...}` payload, and on index-required paths (`body`/`attachments` scopes, date filters, no index built) it returned `[]` where every other name raised. Both differences worked as an oracle: probe `search()` with candidate account names and the odd one out is a name the user deliberately hid. An excluded account now produces exactly the response a name that matches nothing would produce in the same state — same hints, same errors — while the backends still never touch it. The JXA-fallback guard for "every account is excluded" is aligned to the same shape. (#90)
- **A server started before its index exists now participates in single-writer locking.** `serve` only acquired the index writer lock when an index was already present, so a no-index server kept full index-writer status with no lock held — and its opportunistic writes (stale-entry cleanup, parse-failure records) could create a brand-new empty database file concurrently with an `apple-mail-mcp index` build that legitimately held the lock. The lock is now acquired unconditionally: a no-index server that loses it runs index-passive (it cannot create a competing database) and promotes automatically when the lock frees. (#106)
- **`search()` no longer reports an unusable index as an empty mailbox.** A missing index, an index containing 0 emails, and a genuine zero-match all returned the same `{"result": [], "hint": ...}` payload, and the hint suggested trying different keywords. That is good advice for a real no-match (#99) and actively misleading otherwise: it tells the calling model its vocabulary was wrong, so it rephrases and retries instead of diagnosing, and every retry produces the same empty result and the same hint. One user lost roughly four months of silently empty searches over an 18,232-message mailbox this way — `apple-mail-mcp status` would have said "no index" the whole time, but nothing on the search path ever looked. The zero-match hint is unchanged; the other two states now name the index path, the `apple-mail-mcp index` command, and the Full Disk Access prerequisite. Scopes that only the index can serve (`body`, `attachments`, and any `before`/`after` filter) raise with the same guidance rather than returning empty — `scope="body"` previously fell through to the JXA fallback, which searches subject and sender, and returned those matches labelled `matched_in: "body"`. An index that exists but cannot be opened now reports the access problem and its path instead of a bare "Search index error". (#110)
- **A background sync that cannot read your mail no longer reports "Index up to date".** `sync_updates()` catches a `PermissionError` from the Mail directory and returns 0 changes, which is indistinguishable from a clean sync — so a server whose launching process lacks Full Disk Access printed the healthy message on every startup while the index froze at its last good state. The manager now records *why* a sync returned nothing, and `serve` prints a one-time warning naming Full Disk Access (or a missing Mail directory) instead. Starting the server with no index at all also says so, rather than starting silently. The docs claimed the server "does not need Full Disk Access" — true for serving an existing index, not for keeping one current; corrected. (#110)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Concurrent `--watch` instances no longer fight over the index.** Claude Desktop spawns every MCP server twice, and two instances running reconciliation plus a file watcher against the same database treated each other's writes as drift and reverted them in a ping-pong loop — 74 MB of WAL growth in 13 minutes and FTS queries blocked for minutes on the reporter's machine. `serve` now takes an advisory `flock` on `index.db.lock` before its background sync: the winner is the sole index writer, and every other instance runs index-passive (mail tools unaffected, no sync or watcher) while retrying the lock every `lock_retry_seconds` (default 180, env `APPLE_MAIL_LOCK_RETRY_SECONDS` / `[server] lock_retry_seconds`). The kernel releases the lock if the writer exits or crashes, so a survivor promotes automatically — no stale-lockfile cleanup. CLI `index` and `rebuild` wait up to 30s for the lock, then fail with instructions instead of racing a running server. The lock is per-database and independent of `read_only`, which gates JXA mail mutations. (#106, #108)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_EXCLUDE_ACCOUNTS` — hide entire accounts from the server.** A comma-separated env var (and `[index] exclude_accounts` TOML key) listing account *display names* (exact, case-sensitive, like `APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`) that should be invisible to the whole MCP server — not just skipped at index time. Excluded accounts are: never written to the index (`index`/`rebuild`/`--watch` skip them), filtered out of `search()` results (defense-in-depth for any stale rows), and gated out of the live tools — `list_accounts`, `list_mailboxes`, `get_emails`, and `get_email` all behave as if the account does not exist (empty results / "not found"), with no fall-through to JXA. `apple-mail-mcp status` and the `index://status` resource report the configured exclusions. Motivated by users with regulated-data accounts (e.g. PHI) on a shared machine who need a first-class way to keep an account out of LLM reach. Because account display names exist only via JXA (the index stores UUIDs), names are resolved to UUIDs with a single JXA call that runs *only* when exclusions are configured — the common no-exclusions path stays JXA-free. A configured name that matches no account is logged at WARNING and left unhidden, so typos fail loud rather than silently exposing mail. The `disk_email_count` stat (`status` / `index://status`) also skips excluded accounts (once resolved), so exclusions don't read as a fake index-coverage gap. **Known limitation:** `get_email()` called with a raw `message_id` and *no* account, for a message in an excluded account, can still be reached via the live JXA fallback (the account isn't known until the message is located). In practice the message id is undiscoverable through the (now-filtered) listing/search tools. (#90)

### Fixed

- **Clean "not found" errors instead of raw JXA noise.** A missing message id (`get_email`) and an unknown mailbox (`get_emails`) previously surfaced the underlying doubled-up JXA failure (`...Error: Error: Message not found... (-1728)` / `Can't get object. (-1728)`). These now return concise, model-friendly messages — `Message <id> not found.` and `Mailbox '<name>' not found in account '<account>'.` — while genuine failures (Mail.app down, permissions) still propagate intact. (#76)
- **`get_emails()` no longer returns `[]` for Gmail-backed accounts**: the Envelope Index fast path matched mailbox membership only via the `messages.mailbox` FK and a raw-name `LIKE` on the mailbox URL. Gmail accounts keep every message in `[Gmail]/All Mail`, with INBOX (and other label-backed mailbox) membership recorded only in the `labels` table, so INBOX queries matched zero rows and returned a silent empty list; mailbox names containing spaces or brackets ("Sent Mail", "All Mail") also never matched because URLs store percent-encoded paths. The fast path now resolves the requested mailbox to ROWIDs first (percent-decoding URLs, matching the full path or its bare final segment, case-insensitively) and treats a message as a member via either `messages.mailbox` or a `labels` row. An unknown mailbox raises the new `MailboxNotFoundError` and falls back to JXA instead of masquerading as an empty mailbox. Two adjacent silent-scoping holes are closed in the same path: an unresolvable account name now falls back to JXA instead of silently querying every account, and an unspecified account scopes to the first account (matching the documented default and the JXA path) instead of all of them. (#102)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Watcher transaction discipline** — `_process_pending()` ran deletes and adds inside one implicit transaction with a single commit and no rollback on `sqlite3.Error`. Python's `sqlite3` holds an implicit transaction open until commit/rollback, so a mid-batch failure left partial work pending that the *next* batch's commit would silently persist. Deletes and adds now commit as separate transactions, each rolling back on failure. Both `watcher.py` and `sync.py` also switch from a separate `SELECT last_insert_rowid()` statement to `cursor.lastrowid`, which can't be invalidated by interleaved statements. (#95)
- **Inline images without a MIME filename are now indexed and retrievable** — `multipart/related` HTML email (newsletters, marketing, rich-formatted business mail) embeds images as inline parts with a `Content-ID` and no filename. `_extract_attachments` dropped them, so `attachment_count` read 0 and the parts were unreachable. Such parts now get a synthetic `inline_<cid>.<ext>` filename derived from the sanitized Content-ID plus a mime-type extension; `get_attachment_content` derives the same name, so the advertised filename retrieves the bytes. (#86)
- **Input validation at the MCP tool boundary** — `limit`/`offset` are clamped (negative `LIMIT` means *unlimited* in SQLite; oversized limits push entire result sets into the model's context — ceiling is 200), `before`/`after` must be canonical zero-padded `YYYY-MM-DD` (malformed dates previously flowed into SQL string comparisons and silently returned wrong results; the explicit `ValueError` lets the calling model self-correct), and the `APPLE_MAIL_STRATEGY3_*` env vars are clamped to sane ranges. (#96)

### Performance

- **`_flush_batch` no longer issues one SELECT per attachment-bearing email** — rows with attachments insert individually via `cursor.lastrowid` (`INSERT OR REPLACE` always yields a fresh rowid); the attachment-free majority keeps the `executemany` fast path. Removes hundreds of redundant queries per batch during full index builds. (#97)

### Changed

- **CI now runs the test suite** — `lint.yml` previously ran only ruff; the suite ran exclusively on the maintainer's machine. A new job runs pytest on `macos-latest` across Python 3.11/3.12/3.13. (#94)
- **`tests/test_v016.py` split by feature** — the version-named regression dump's 9 classes moved to `test_watcher.py`, `test_disk.py`, `test_server.py`, and `test_cli_profile.py`. Also adds the suite's first real-file SQLite contention test (the shared fixtures use `:memory:`, which never locks). (#98)
- **`search()` docstring documents the empty-result shape** — the deliberate `{"result": [], "hint": ...}` dict on zero matches is now described in the Returns section. (#99)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Performance

- **`list_accounts()` and `get_emails()` now skip the AppleScript round-trip on the fast path** — both tools previously spawned `osascript` for every call, paying the JXA IPC ceiling (~150ms and ~1.2s respectively on a ~73K-message mailbox). `list_accounts()` now serves from the existing `AccountMap` cache (5-minute TTL) when warm — repeat calls within a session drop from ~150ms to ~1ms. `get_emails()` reads Apple's Envelope Index SQLite directly (the same `~/Library/Mail/V*/MailData/Envelope Index` that BastianZim, rusty, and pl-lyfx query), joining through the `subjects` and `addresses` lookup tables to materialize text columns — every filter (`all`, `unread`, `flagged`, `today`, `last_7_days`, `this_week`) is served from direct integer columns on `messages` without any JXA fallback for live state. Measured 75–250× speedup on a ~73K-message mailbox: list_accounts 153ms→~2ms (warm), get_emails 1247ms→~5ms. Both tools cascade to the existing JXA path automatically if the Envelope Index isn't accessible (schema mismatch, missing file, restrictive permissions), preserving correctness on any Mail.app build. New module `index/envelope_direct.py` with 22 unit tests; `index/accounts.py` gains `reset()` and `get_cached_accounts()` for the cache path and test isolation.

### Added

- **TOML configuration file at `~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml`** — every existing `APPLE_MAIL_*` env var now has a sibling key in a structured TOML file. Resolution order is CLI flag > environment variable > file value > built-in default, so existing env-only deployments keep working unchanged. The file is for durable user policy (default account/mailbox, index scope, read-only) that's awkward to maintain across multiple MCP client configs — set it once in `config.toml` instead of pasting the same `env: {}` block into Claude Desktop + Cursor + Cline. Schema is versioned (`config_version = 1`) and validated with file-path context: bad keys, wrong types, negative values, version mismatches, and a subtle bool-in-int-slot trap all fail loud rather than silently degrading. The "empty list = explicit empty, not default" semantics are intentional and tested — `exclude_mailboxes = []` means "no exclusions" rather than falling back to the `{"Drafts"}` default. New `tomllib`-based loader (stdlib in 3.11+) with no added runtime dependency. 33 new tests in `tests/test_config.py` cover the precedence semantics across all four layers.
- **`apple-mail-mcp init` CLI command** — writes a heavily-commented `config.toml` template to `~/.apple-mail-mcp/`. Every available key is documented inline alongside its matching env var; all values are commented out so the template preserves current defaults and users opt in by uncommenting. The file is written with `0o600` permissions, matching the project's existing posture for `index.db` and the attachment cache. `--force` overrides an existing file. A roundtrip test loads the template back through the validator on every run, catching any drift between the schema and the documentation before it reaches a user.
- **Read-only mode is now enforced at MCP tool boundaries (#80)** — `_ensure_writable()` helper in `server.py` raises `PermissionError` when read-only is active (via env, TOML key, or `apple-mail-mcp serve -r`). Future write tools must call this as their first line. An AST-based regression test in `tests/test_server.py` scans `server.py` for `@mcp.tool` functions whose names start with write-implying prefixes (`mark_`, `move_`, `send_`, `reply_`, `forward_`, `delete_`, `create_`, `update_`, `set_`, `archive_`, `trash_`, `flag_`, `unflag_`) and asserts each one calls the guard. Passes vacuously today (no write tools exist), fires the moment a contributor forgets the check on a future write tool. The flag was decorative before; the infrastructure now in place keeps it honest as the write-ops cluster (#22, #23, #24, #64, #65) lands.

### Documentation

- **`docs/configuration.md`** restructured around TOML-first with env vars as overrides. New "Precedence" section documents the CLI > env > file > default order, and the env-var table gains a matching TOML-key column.
- **`CLAUDE.md` Configuration section** updated with the new precedence model, matching TOML key column, empty-list semantics note, and #80 enforcement pointer. `apple-mail-mcp init` added to the CLI Commands list.
- **README** gains a brief "Configure (Optional)" subsection pointing to `apple-mail-mcp init` and the configuration docs.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **External-attachment lookup for nested MIME parts** — Apple Mail stores externally-referenced attachments under `Attachments/<msg_id>/<part>/` where `<part>` is an RFC-style MIME part number. Top-level parts use flat integers (`2/`), but nested parts (common in forwarded emails: `multipart/mixed > multipart/mixed > application/pdf`) use dot notation (`2.2/`, `1.16/`, etc.). The previous implementation tracked a flat attachment counter and routed every lookup to a top-level subdir, so any nested attachment came back as `size: 0` from `parse_emlx()` and `None` from `get_attachment_content()`. New `_mime_part_numbers()` helper walks the MIME tree and builds an `id(part) → "2.2"` map; `_extract_attachments()`, `get_attachment_content()`, and `_find_external_attachment()` now use real part numbers instead of the flat counter. Scoped check against a real ~72K-message mailbox: 4,063 dot-notation subdirs (~18% of all attachments) were affected; flat-attachment behavior is preserved (regression test included). Thanks to @scottwb for the fix and tests. (#85)
- **Hardened `_mime_part_numbers` lookup fallback** — `_extract_attachments` and `get_attachment_content` used `part_numbers.get(id(part), "")` to resolve the MIME part number for the external-attachment subdir lookup. An empty-string fallback would silently collapse the `Path / "<subdir>"` join to the attachments root directory (`Path("/x") / "" == Path("/x")`), potentially returning a wrong file via the single-file-in-dir fallback in `_find_external_attachment`. Both call sites now check for a missing part number explicitly and skip the external lookup rather than misroute. Defensive — doesn't trigger today (the helper covers every leaf part), but locks in the invariant for future refactors. Two new regression tests in `TestMimePartNumbersFallback`.

### Security

- **Attachment cache files are now chmod'd to `0o600`** — `get_email_attachment` and `get_attachment` write extracted attachment content to `~/.apple-mail-mcp/attachments/<random>/<filename>`. The cache directory was already `0o700`, but the file itself inherited the user's umask (typically `0o644`). On single-user installs this is moot, but on shared hosts (CI runners, multi-user dev VMs, lab machines) other local users could read the cached attachment content before the 24-hour cleanup. The file is now explicitly `chmod`'d to `0o600` immediately after write, matching the existing `0o600` posture documented for the index database. New regression test in `TestGetAttachment`. (#79)

### Changed

- **CI workflows opt into Node 24 ahead of the forced cutover** — `lint.yml` and `release.yml` now set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` at the workflow level. GitHub will force all JavaScript actions to Node 24 by default on June 2nd, 2026, and remove Node 20 from runners on September 16th, 2026. Opting in now silences the deprecation warning that appears on every Actions run today and verifies our pinned action versions (`actions/checkout@v4`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, `actions/download-artifact@v4`, `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`) work correctly on the newer runtime well before it becomes mandatory.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`--profile PATH` flag on `index` and `rebuild`** — wraps the operation in `cProfile` and writes a `pstats`-format dump to the given path. Stdlib-only (no new runtime dependencies). Intended for users diagnosing slow indexing on their own data and for sharing actionable performance traces in bug reports. Documented in `docs/profiling.md` along with recommended visualizers (`flameprof` for flame charts, `gprof2dot` for call graphs, `snakeviz` for interactive exploration). Surfaced in response to community feedback on #60 — wall-clock invariance at 100k+ mailbox scale was hard to diagnose without a contributor-friendly profiling path. Open follow-up tracked in #84 (sync inventory walk dominates wall-clock at >100k mailboxes) — large-mailbox contributors are explicitly asked to share `--profile` dumps there. `flameprof>=0.4` added to the `dev` dependency group so contributors get a flame-chart renderer on `uv sync`.
- **`docs/profiling.md`** — methodology page covering when to profile, how to capture, how to read the two halves of a flame chart (cumulative vs self-time), and what patterns in a profile signal which optimization strategies. Includes a reference breakdown from a real ~60k-message mailbox showing balanced overhead across the parse pipeline (no single dominant bottleneck on this dataset). Wired into the mkdocs nav.

### Fixed

- **`index://status` resource no longer walks the disk on every call** — `IndexManager.get_stats()` now caches `disk_email_count` with a 60-second TTL via a new `_get_disk_email_count_cached()` helper. Previously, every read of the `index://status` MCP resource triggered a full `get_disk_inventory()` filesystem walk under `~/Library/Mail/V*/`, which is O(N files) and would dominate response latency for clients polling the resource on a tight loop. The cache is automatically invalidated at the end of `build_from_disk()` and `sync_updates()` so the next status call after a sync reflects truth. Failures (`PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`) are deliberately *not* cached so subsequent calls retry in case Full Disk Access has since been granted. New public `invalidate_disk_count_cache()` method for callers that need to force a fresh read. (#78)
- **Memory allocation in `_estimate_attachment_size`** — replaced chained `raw.replace("\n", "").replace("\r", "").replace(" ", "")` with `str.count()` (allocation-free) followed by a bounded trailing-padding scan. Verified via `tracemalloc` on a 19.3 MB base64 payload: peak allocation drops from **38.4 MB → 19.3 MB** (2x reduction; new impl peak equals input size, allocating nothing additional). The original issue's "80 MB" estimate assumed all three `.replace()` calls would each allocate a full copy, but CPython short-circuits `str.replace` when no replacements occur — so the realistic peak is 2x not 4x. Still real, still GC-pressure-inducing during bulk indexing of attachment-heavy mailboxes. The fix preserves exact semantics — including the padding subtraction that the originally-proposed Option B (`int(len(raw) * 0.75)`) would have lost — verified by the existing `test_base64_size_estimation` test plus a new whitespace-heavy regression test. (#81)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **`APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` is now uncapped by default** — the per-mailbox ceiling that silently truncated large mailboxes at 5000 messages is gone. The env var still works as an opt-in ceiling for users who want to bound disk/memory usage; setting it to an integer enforces the same per-mailbox limit as before. `get_index_max_emails()` returns `int | None` and all consumers (sync, build_from_disk, get_stats) treat `None` as no cap. The 5000 default predated disk-first sync (when JXA timed out at 60s and 5000 was the realistic indexable count); the bottleneck has long since moved, and the silent default no longer matched the README's "full-coverage body search" claim. Existing indexes built under the old default will *not* automatically backfill older messages — run `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` to re-index without the cap.
- **`apple-mail-mcp status` surfaces capped mailboxes** — when `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` is set and any mailbox is at the ceiling, `status` now prints a "Capped: N mailbox(es)" line with a hint to raise or unset the env var. Previously this state was only visible via the `index://status` MCP resource.

### Documentation

- **Removed the "Migrating from apple-mcp?" README section** — the `supermemoryai/apple-mcp` migration table was kept for compatibility framing during the early v0.x cycle. The reference is no longer load-bearing for new users; dropping it tightens the README without losing information that's still findable in v0.3.0 release notes if needed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Watcher race during `build_from_disk()`** — in `IndexManager.build_from_disk` the FTS5 sync triggers were dropped for the bulk-insert pass and recreated *after* `rebuild_fts_index()`. Any concurrent INSERT (file watcher, separate process holding `--watch`) that landed between the FTS rebuild and the trigger recreation entered `emails` but never reached `emails_fts`, leaving the row permanently unsearchable. The trigger recreation now happens *before* the FTS rebuild — concurrent inserts during the rebuild fire the recreated trigger, and the rebuild itself re-syncs everything in `emails`, double-covering the window. (Surfaced via Gemini code review.)
- **Stale FTS5 entry auto-cleanup** — when `get_email()` Strategy 0 finds an indexed `.emlx` path that no longer exists on disk (the message was deleted or moved between syncs), the dead row is now removed from the index and a clear `"deleted or moved"` error is returned. Previously the cascade fell through to Strategy 3 and timed out (~1.3% of `get_email` calls in observed traffic). Adds `IndexManager.delete_email()` primitive. (#74)
- **Dead letter queue for `.emlx` parse failures** — files that fail to parse in the watcher or disk-sync paths are now recorded in a new `failed_index_jobs` table (path, account, mailbox, error type/message, first/last seen, attempt count). Previously such failures were swallowed silently after the v0.1.8 watcher hardening. Successful re-parses automatically clear the entry. Surfaced in `apple-mail-mcp status` and the `index://status` resource via a new `failed_jobs_count`. Schema bumped to v5 with a forward-only migration. (#58)
- **DLQ write failures now log at ERROR level** — when the `failed_index_jobs` INSERT itself fails (disk full, DB corruption, schema mismatch), both the watcher and disk-sync paths now log at ERROR with diagnostic context instead of swallowing silently (sync) or emitting WARNING (watcher). Surfaces operationally-significant failure modes that were previously invisible. (#77)

### Changed

- **`cyclopts` constraint relaxed to stable** — was `>=5.0.0a1` (pre-release), now `>=4.10`. Removes the need for `--prerelease=allow` in `claude_desktop_config.json` and other install configs. No API changes; the cyclopts surface used by `cli.py` is identical between 4.x and 5.x. (#75)
- **HTML stripping during indexing now uses selectolax** (lexbor C parser) for ~5x faster `_strip_html()` on realistic email HTML (5-25 KB body parts). BeautifulSoup is kept as a fallback if selectolax raises or fails to import. All existing XSS-bypass tests pass under both paths. New `selectolax>=0.4.8` dependency. (#59)
- **`sync_from_disk()` now uses a SQL temp table for diffing** instead of materializing the full disk and DB inventories as Python dicts. Memory at sync time stays flat (~2-3 MB delta) regardless of mailbox size; previously the dicts grew linearly to ~116 MB at 200K emails. Time cost is ~1.8x (sub-second even at 200K). Adds `iter_disk_inventory()` streaming variant of `get_disk_inventory()` in `disk.py`. All existing sync tests pass — behavior is preserved (added/deleted/moved counts, mtime sort, per-mailbox cap). (#60)

### Added

- **`index://status` MCP resource** — read-only JSON snapshot of the FTS5 search index (counts, size, last sync, staleness). Lets MCP clients assess index health without invoking a tool. (#12)
- **Benchmark suite expansion + refresh** — added `sweetrb/apple-mail-mcp` (TypeScript, AppleScript-based, 40+ tools, npm) and `BastianZim/apple-mail-mcp` (Python, reads Envelope Index SQLite + `.emlx` directly, no AppleScript) to the competitor list, then re-ran the full sweep on a 72K-message mailbox. Charts and the benchmarks doc are refreshed; positioning copy updated to reflect that the FTS5 differentiator is now precisely "full-coverage body search" — BastianZim implements a body parameter but caps live-scanning at the 5000 most recent messages (silent miss on older mail). Per-scenario charts now mark BastianZim as "5K cap" in the capability matrix and exclude it from the body-search bar chart so the comparison stays apples-to-apples.
- **`server.json` declares `runtimeHint: "uvx"`** — spec-compliant signal to MCP registries that the canonical launch command is `uvx apple-mail-mcp`. No effect on existing clients that already invoke the package directly.

### Documentation

- **Discovery descriptions refreshed** — `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, and `mkdocs.yml` all now describe the project as "Apple Mail MCP server with full-coverage FTS5 body search. Reliable on large mailboxes where AppleScript-based servers timeout." Replaces the older "the only one that works reliably" wording, which the v0.3.0 bench refresh showed was no longer uniquely ours (BastianZim also handles large mailboxes — just with a 5000-message body-search cap).
- **Schema-version references updated to v5** across `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/search.md`.
- **New documentation sections** for the `index://status` MCP resource (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/tools.md`) and the `failed_index_jobs` DLQ (`docs/search.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Mailbox name alias resolution** — JXA `getMailbox()` now resolves common cross-provider aliases (e.g., `Sent Messages` → `Sent Items` on Outlook, `Trash` → `Deleted Items`) and falls back to case-insensitive matching. (#73)
- **Configurable Strategy 3 timeout** — Strategy 3 (iterate-all-mailboxes fallback in `get_email`) now exposes `APPLE_MAIL_STRATEGY3_TIMEOUT` and `APPLE_MAIL_STRATEGY3_MAX_MAILBOXES` environment variables.

### Fixed

- **Bare wildcard `*` query** — no longer crashes FTS5 with a syntax error. (#72)

### Tests

- Added watcher tests for noisy events, nested mbox, V11 directory layouts, and pending-changes limits.
- Added corrupt `.emlx` parser tests (bad byte counts, truncated content, empty files, missing newline). +10 tests; total 325 passing.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Search pagination** — new `offset` parameter on `search()` for paginated results. Use with `limit` to page through large result sets. (#8)
- **Status command completeness** — `apple-mail-mcp status` now reports attachment count, disk email count, and index coverage percentage. (#43)

### Changed

- **Strategy 3 JXA moved to builders.py** — the inline JXA script for iterating all mailboxes is now a `GetEmailBuilder` class, consistent with the existing builder pattern. (#56)

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive attachment filename matching** — `get_email_attachment` now matches filenames regardless of case or whitespace, fixing failures when LLM clients re-serialize filenames with minor differences. (#71)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Date-range filtering for search** — new `before` and `after` parameters (YYYY-MM-DD) on `search()`. Filter results by date across all scopes including attachments. (#9)
- **Highlighted search results** — new `highlight` parameter on `search()`. When enabled, matched terms are wrapped in `**markers**` in subject and content_snippet using FTS5 `highlight()` and `snippet()`. (#11)
- **`get_email_links()` tool** — extracts hyperlinks from an email's HTML content. Replaces the links mode of `get_attachment()`. (#55)
- **`get_email_attachment()` tool** — extracts a named file attachment and saves to disk. Replaces the attachment mode of `get_attachment()`. (#55)
- **CLI wrappers** — all MCP tools now accessible as CLI commands: `search`, `read`, `emails`, `accounts`, `mailboxes`, `extract`. Output JSON to stdout. (#61)
- **Skill generator** — `apple-mail-mcp integrate claude` generates a Claude Code skill file for CLI-based email access. (#62)
- **`--read-only` server flag** — `apple-mail-mcp serve --read-only` (or `APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY=true`) prepares for v0.3.0 write operations. (#63)
- **Dynamic Mail version detection** — auto-detects the highest `V*` directory under `~/Library/Mail/` instead of hardcoding `V10`. (#57)

### Changed

- **`get_attachment()` deprecated** — still registered for backwards compatibility, but delegates to `get_email_links()` or `get_email_attachment()`. Will be removed in v0.3.0.

### Fixed (from v0.1.8)

- **Watcher crash on file add** — `parse_emlx()` exceptions beyond `OSError`/`ValueError`/`UnicodeDecodeError` (e.g. malformed plist, missing headers) no longer kill the watcher thread. The watcher now skips unparseable files and continues processing.
- **Attachment cache leak** — `_cleanup_old_attachments()` is now called automatically when extracting attachments, preventing unbounded disk usage from cached files.
- **Attachment cache permissions** — cache directory is now created with `0o700` permissions to protect sensitive email attachment content.
- **Empty search error messages** — search index errors (corrupt DB, SQLite issues) now return actionable error messages instead of empty strings. Suggests `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` when the index is broken.
- **Misleading get_email timeout message** — when `get_email` times out, the error now checks whether account/mailbox were already provided and gives context-appropriate advice instead of always saying "Provide account/mailbox".
- **Renamed `this_week` filter to `last_7_days`** — `this_week` kept as alias for backwards compatibility. (#49)
- **`search_fts_highlight()` bugs** — fixed missing account/mailbox/exclude_mailboxes filters, integer row indexing, and missing FTS5 retry logic.
- **Case-sensitive mailbox filtering** — `search(mailbox="INBOX")` now matches `Inbox`, `inbox`, etc. Previously returned zero results on case mismatch. (#67)
- **Updated patrickfreyer benchmark config** and added `rusty_apple_mail_mcp` to benchmarks.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Strategy 0 (disk read) for `get_email()`** — reads email content directly from `.emlx` files on disk, bypassing JXA/Apple Events entirely. Fastest path when the search index is available. Falls through to JXA strategies on failure. (Thanks to @vkostakos for the initial implementation in PR #53)
- Extracts read/flagged status from `.emlx` plist footer flags bitmask
- Extracts `date_sent`, `reply_to`, `Message-ID` from MIME headers for full schema parity
- `get_email` benchmark scenario with dynamic message ID discovery
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for new contributors
- This changelog

### Fixed

- `date_received` now uses the `Received` header (delivery time) instead of `Date` header (composition time). Previously both `date_received` and `date_sent` were identical. Run `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` after upgrading to fix historical emails.

### Changed

- Updated project messaging across all descriptions to reflect disk-first architecture
- Re-ran competitive benchmarks with new `get_email` scenario
