# Configuration

Apple Mail MCP can be configured via a TOML config file at
`~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml`, environment variables, or both. All
settings have sensible defaults — no configuration is required to get
started.

## Quick start

Generate a commented config file:

```bash
apple-mail-mcp init
```

This writes `~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml` with every available key
documented inline. All values are commented out, so defaults remain in
effect — uncomment what you want to override. Pass `--force` to
overwrite an existing config file.

## Configuration file

The TOML file at `~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml` is loaded on every
server start. All sections and keys are optional.

```toml
config_version = 1

[defaults]
# account = "Personal"          # Default email account
# mailbox = "INBOX"             # Default mailbox

[index]
# path = "~/.apple-mail-mcp/index.db"   # FTS5 database location
# max_emails = 5000             # Per-mailbox ceiling (omit for uncapped)
# staleness_hours = 24.0        # Hours before re-sync
# exclude_mailboxes = ["Drafts"]   # Mailboxes to skip during indexing
# exclude_accounts = ["Work PHI"]  # Accounts to hide from the whole server

[server]
# read_only = false             # Disable write operations
# lock_retry_seconds = 180      # Index-passive lock retry interval
```

**Empty list semantics**: `exclude_mailboxes = []` explicitly means "no
exclusions" — different from omitting the key, which uses the
`["Drafts"]` default.

**Account exclusion is a global boundary**: `exclude_accounts` lists
account *display names* (exact, case-sensitive) that the server treats
as nonexistent. They are never written to the index, filtered out of
`search()`, and made invisible to `list_accounts`, `list_mailboxes`,
`get_emails`, and `get_email` (no fall-through to live JXA). There is no
default — an account is hidden only when explicitly named, and a name
that matches no account is logged as a warning rather than silently
ignored. Use it to keep a regulated-data account (e.g. PHI) out of LLM
reach. A hidden account behaves exactly like an account that does not
exist: `get_email()` raises the same `Email <id> not found.` whether or
not the id is known, `search()` returns the same hints and errors a
name that matches nothing would get, and no strategy — disk, index, or
live JXA — is allowed to target it.

**Validation**: malformed TOML, unknown keys, type mismatches, and
`config_version` mismatches all raise a clear error with the file path
and the offending key. The server refuses to start rather than silently
using degraded config.

## Environment variables

Every config key can also be set via an environment variable. Env vars
override TOML file values, which is useful for per-deployment overrides
in CI or in MCP client launch configs.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` | First account | Default email account for all tools |
| `APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_MAILBOX` | `INBOX` | Default mailbox when none specified |
| `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_PATH` | `~/.apple-mail-mcp/index.db` | SQLite index database location |
| `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` | _unset_ | Optional per-mailbox ceiling (default: uncapped) |
| `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_STALENESS_HOURS` | `24` | Hours before index is considered stale |
| `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_EXCLUDE_MAILBOXES` | `Drafts` | Comma-separated mailboxes to skip in search |
| `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_EXCLUDE_ACCOUNTS` | _unset_ | Comma-separated account names (exact, case-sensitive) hidden from the entire server: never indexed, filtered from search, invisible to the list/get tools |
| `APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY` | `false` | When `true`, disables any write operations |
| `APPLE_MAIL_LOCK_RETRY_SECONDS` | `180` | How often an index-passive server instance retries the index writer lock (minimum 1) |

## Precedence

When the same value is set in multiple places, the highest-precedence
source wins. From highest to lowest:

1. **CLI flags** (e.g. `apple-mail-mcp serve -r`)
2. **Environment variables** (`APPLE_MAIL_*`)
3. **TOML config file** (`~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml`)
4. **Built-in defaults**

For multi-client deployments (Claude Desktop + Cursor + Cline + ...),
the TOML file is the cleanest place for durable user policy — set it
once instead of pasting the same `env: {}` block into every client.

## Per-mailbox email limit (optional)

By default the index covers every email in every mailbox — there is no
per-mailbox cap. Set `APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS` (or `[index] max_emails`
in `config.toml`) to opt in to a ceiling, useful if you want to bound
index size on machines with many large mailboxes:

```bash
export APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_MAX_EMAILS=10000
apple-mail-mcp rebuild
```

When a cap is set and a mailbox exceeds it, the most recent emails by
file modification time are kept. `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` reports how
many mailboxes hit the cap, and `apple-mail-mcp status` surfaces the
same information after the fact.

## Read-only mode

Use `--read-only` (or `-r`) on the `serve` command to prevent any write
operations. This can also be set via the `APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY`
environment variable or `[server] read_only = true` in `config.toml`.

```bash
apple-mail-mcp serve --read-only
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export APPLE_MAIL_READ_ONLY=true
apple-mail-mcp serve
```

## Single index writer

Only one server process syncs and watches the index at a time. On
startup, each `serve` instance tries to take an advisory lock on
`index.db.lock` next to the database. The winner runs the background
sync (and the file watcher with `--watch`); any other instance runs
**index-passive** — searches and mail actions work normally, but it
leaves index writes to the winner. This makes it safe for MCP clients
that spawn multiple server instances (Claude Desktop starts every
configured server twice).

A passive instance retries the lock every `lock_retry_seconds`
(default 180) and takes over automatically if the writer exits — the
lock is released by the kernel even on a crash, so no cleanup is ever
needed.

`apple-mail-mcp index` and `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` need the same lock.
If a running server holds it, they wait briefly and then exit with an
error — stop the server, run the command, then start the server again.
(A server left running in passive mode picks the lock back up within
one retry interval of the command finishing.)

Note that this is unrelated to read-only mode: `read_only` restricts
what MCP tools may do to your mail; index-passive only concerns which
process maintains the search index.

When read-only mode is active, write-capable MCP tools raise
`PermissionError` with a clear message rather than silently no-oping.

## Index location

The FTS5 index database is stored at `~/.apple-mail-mcp/index.db` by
default. Override via the env var or TOML key:

```bash
export APPLE_MAIL_INDEX_PATH="/path/to/custom/index.db"
```

```toml
[index]
path = "/path/to/custom/index.db"
```

The database file is created with `0600` permissions (owner read/write
only) for security. The same posture applies to `config.toml` (created
by `apple-mail-mcp init`) and the attachment cache.

## MCP client configuration

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mail": {
      "command": "apple-mail-mcp",
      "env": {
        "APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT": "Work",
        "APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_MAILBOX": "INBOX"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you have multiple MCP clients, consider setting durable defaults in
`~/.apple-mail-mcp/config.toml` instead, and keep the `env` block here
for per-client overrides only.

### Claude Code

Edit `.mcp.json` in your project root or `~/.claude/mcp.json` globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mail": {
      "command": "apple-mail-mcp",
      "env": {
        "APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT": "Work"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With real-time indexing

To keep the search index automatically updated:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mail": {
      "command": "apple-mail-mcp",
      "args": ["--watch"],
      "env": {
        "APPLE_MAIL_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT": "Work"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## CLI commands

```bash
apple-mail-mcp              # Run MCP server (default)
apple-mail-mcp serve        # Run MCP server explicitly
apple-mail-mcp serve -r     # Run in read-only mode
apple-mail-mcp --watch      # Run with real-time index updates
apple-mail-mcp init         # Write a config.toml template
apple-mail-mcp index        # Build search index from disk
